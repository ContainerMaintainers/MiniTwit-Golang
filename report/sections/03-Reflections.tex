\section{Lessons Learned Perspective}
% Describe the biggest issues, how you solved them, and which are major lessons learned with regards to:
% evolution and refactoring
% operation, and
% maintenance
% of your ITU-MiniTwit systems. Link back to respective commit messages, issues, tickets, etc. to illustrate these.

% Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently from previous development projects and how did it work?

% All discuss

\subsection{Evolution and Refactoring}
Over the course we created a fairly high technical debt. Due to deadlines, we tended to get each job done ``good enough", with the idea to go back and make it perfect later. But later never happened, due to continually more tasks, issues, or feature development. It would have been better to spend the extra time and complete tasks well the first time.

\subsection{Operation}


\subsection{Maintenance}

With more time we would like to implement additional monitoring so that certain qualities of our system are automatically checked. For example, query time to all endpoints to ensure our system is not lagging.


\subsection{Our ``DevOps" Style}
% How much do we adhere to the "three ways" (from the DevOps handbook)
% \href{https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/sessions/session_05/README_TASKS.md}{From this weeks tasks}

% How well did we do on software maintenance (how soon did we fix issues, how often did we deploy)
