# Description of Distributed Workflow

## Repository setup

We have an organization, which contains all relevant repositories.
1 repository contains the original code in python/flask.
A second repository is the main repository worked on, and contains the refacotered version.

## Branching model

We make use of feature-based branching.

## Distributed development workflow

We use a centralized workflow, with all developers working on a shared repository.

## What should contributions look like?

Issues are used to define tasks. Issues are assigned to specific group member(s).
Pull requests show contributers. 

## Responsibility for integrating/reviewing contributions

Someone who isn't a contributer reviews the pull request and confirms it.
